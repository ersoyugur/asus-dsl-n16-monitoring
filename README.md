This repo is a sample including the scripts to receive metrics from asus router (asus dsl-n16 is used) and send all these metrics to influxdb stored on the local machine. also cron function in asus routers is called cru, I also added cru function.

All scripts are taken from the following tutorial, I just made slight changes, because influxdb doesn't provide gui anymore and also api format changed.
